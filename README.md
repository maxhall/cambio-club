Cambio Club is an real-time multiplayer version of Cambio, a memory-based card game.

The game is built with Node, Svelte and [Sapper](https://github.com/sveltejs/sapper-template) (SvelteKit was still in alpha when I kicked off) with websockets for the real-time gameplay.

To develop, clone the repository and run:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

The application can be deployed straight to Heroku without further configuration. It should also run happily wherever you run your Node code.
